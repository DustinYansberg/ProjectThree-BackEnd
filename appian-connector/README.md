# NOTES
1. Make sure to update the build.xml file and .classpath with the proper routes if you want to build
2. The .jar file in the build folder is what goes in apache-tomcat-{version}/webapps/identityiq/WEB-INF/lib
3. If an additional build is needed, you can use the commands specified in the build.xml file
